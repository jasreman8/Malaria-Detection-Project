# Executive Summary

The booming Indian used car market suffers from a **lack of transparency and objectivity** in pricing. Unlike the new car market, used car values are highly uncertain due to factors like mileage, brand, model, and year. 
In a bid to revolutionize the Indian used car market, a highly accurate used car pricing model using a **Random Forest tuned regressor model** (as evidenced by lowest RMSE and MAE, along with the high R-squared and adjusted R-squared values
for training and test datasets in comparison to other models being explored) was developed for Cars4U. This data-driven solution will empower the company to recommend **optimal asking prices, maximizing seller revenue and attracting buyers with
competitive offerings**. The model helps to identify key factors influencing price such as mileage, brand, model, year, and engine specifications. By leveraging this model's superior performance and integrating it into their platform, Cars4U
can establish itself as a **trusted partner, fostering transparency and customer satisfaction**. Furthermore, this approach has the potential to drive market growth and stability. To maximize the model's effectiveness, prioritization on
**data quality** for key features and development of targeted marketing strategies based on car segments is recommended. Integration of random forest tuned regressor model into Cars4U's platform to provide real-time price recommendations 
for sellers, along with developing targeted marketing strategies based on car segments and their defining features is suggested.

## Solution Design

A wide range of models were explored as a part of developing a data-driven solution to predict used car prices accurately including the linear regression model, ridge regression, lasso regression, decision tree (with and without hypterparameter
tuning), and random forest model (with and without hypterparameter tuning) using the test and training datasets (to evaluate for overfitting). After the linear regression model was built, variance inflation factor was used to investigate and
remove multicollinearity, and then model summary report was analyzed to drop insignificant features. The target variable over here was the log of Price. The log of target variable was taken as its distribution was highly skewed.
 - The following table shows the evaluation metrics for the various models that were considered for the test and training datasets.
 - Overfitting was observed for the Decision Tree Regression model as the model performs well on the training data.
 - **Random forest tuned regressor** was the pick amongst the models being compared because of minimum RMSE and MAE along with the highest R-squared and adjusted R-squared for training and test datasets.
 - The key factors influencing price were identified to be mileage, brand, model, year, and engine specifications based on the model results.

## Analysis and Key Insights

To draw accurate insights from the predictive model, **extensive EDA** was conducted. **Feature engineering and outlier treatment** were performed for the columns where it was required. All the nan values for 'Seats' column were replaced 
with the median value for the 'Make' of the car. Even after imputation, there were 129 rows of missing data in the 'New_price' column. Those rows were removed and there were no missing rows in the entire dataset. Log transformation for a
couple of columns was considered as the gaussian distribution for those columns was highly skewed. The min and max values of the 'S.No.' column seemed to have as many values as rows (this column was dropped after investigation). The mean 
and median value of 'Kilometers_driven' were quite far away from the max value (outliers were detected and removed). The minimum 'Mileage' was reported as 0 which cannot be true (median values based on the Make of the car were imputed). 
The column 'New_Price' had so many missing values which were imputed too. The target variable --> 'Price' had missing values as well which were dropped so as to not add bias to the model. Most cars in the inventory were from Mumbai. From
the heatmap, it can be observed that the **target variable is highly correlated to the 'Power', 'Engine', 'Year', and 'New Price'** columns. The results of the heatmap above make sense as **price of the car will tend to increase with the 
'Power' and 'Engine' specifications of the car**. Also, if the car was manufactured recently, the price would tend to be high.

## Recommendations for Implementation

The proposed data science approach offers a **more scalable, efficient, and unbiased solution** for used car price prediction. It will be beneficial for the stakeholders in market, which could lead to a more efficient and transparent 
used car buying and selling experience. By leveraging the power of data science, a used car price prediction model that considers a multitude of relevant features and market data was developed and several recommendations were made. 
This model could:
- **Analyze large datasets** of used car listings to identify key factors influencing price.
- **Learn from historical sales data** to understand market trends and price fluctuations.
- **Predict the fair market value** of a used car based on its specific features and condition.

This approach could lead to **improved efficiency, market transparency, and competitive advantage** to the business stakeholders.

The **key risks and challenges** with this approach would be associated with the **data quality issues, model bias, and market fluctuations**. Inaccurate or incomplete data can negatively impact model performance. The model could potentially
inherit biases present in the training data. Rapid changes in the market trends could require model updates.

For the purpose of used car price prediction, it was observed that the features --> 'Power', 'Year', 'New Price', 'log_kilometers_driven', 'Engine', and 'Mileage' affected the price of the car the most. Therefore, it will be essential
to **ensure data collection and cleaning processes** prioritize their accuracy and completeness. The Random Forest regression model with hyperparameter tuning could be integrated into Cars4U's platform. An interface for sellers to input car
details and receive real-time price recommendations could be developed. The used cars can be **grouped into segments** based on these key features which could allow for more targeted pricing strategies within each segment. For marketing efforts,
focus on emphasizing these features could yield (e.g., horsepower for performance-oriented cars, fuel efficiency, etc.) **better sales**. For business purposes, prioritization on **acquisition of high-demand cars** should be done. The proposed
model could potentially enable business stakeholders to **set optimal prices** for each vehicle, leading to increased revenue through data-driven pricing strategies. This model will equip business stakeholders with the ability to
**implement effective differential pricing, ultimately increasing profitability**.

For **further analysis and associated problems**, exploring incorporating of **additional data sources** like car condition reports or regional market variations could be considered. In addition to that, **investigating the feasibility of 
predicting future price trends** for informed pricing strategies could be done.

By addressing these recommendations and challenges, Cars4U can unlock the full potential of the data science approach and revolutionize the used car buying and selling experience in India.
