# MALARIA DETECTION (DEEP LEARNING CASE STUDY)

## Problem Definition

### The Context:
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It affects nearly half of the global population, with over 229 million cases and 400,000 deaths reported in 2019 â€” 67% of which were children under five. The parasite can remain in the body for over a year without symptoms, making early detection critical. Traditional diagnosis relies on manual inspection of red blood cells (RBCs), which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to human error. Automating this process using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques has shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This project aims to develop an AI-based solution for accurate and early malaria detection.

### The objective:

 - The goal is to build an efficient computer vision model that can automatically detect malaria by analyzing images of red blood cells. The model should classify each cell image as either parasitized (infected with malaria) or uninfected, enabling fast and accurate diagnosis.

### The key questions:
 - The key questions that need to be addressed to build an effective and reliable solution are as follows:
  - Can we accurately detect malaria-infected red blood cells using image data?
  - What deep learning architecture yields the best performance for malaria classification?
  - How can we optimize the model for both accuracy and computational efficiency?
  - What is the minimum amount of data or preprocessing required to achieve high accuracy?
  - How generalizable is the model across different datasets or imaging conditions?

### The problem formulation:
This project aims to solve a binary image classification problem using data science and deep learning techniques. Specifically, the task is to develop a computer vision model that can:
 - Take as input an image of a red blood cell from a blood smear,
 - Automatically analyze the visual features,
 - And classify the image as either parasitized (malaria-infected) or uninfected.

The broader objective is to support rapid, accurate, and scalable malaria diagnosis in clinical and resource-constrained settings, thereby reducing dependence on manual microscopy and enabling timely treatment.

## Recommendations for Implementation
The proposed data science approach offers a **more scalable, efficient, and unbiased solution** for malaria detection. Among all approaches tested, the initial custom-built CNN model consistently outperformed other models. It achieved the highest accuracy with significantly lower false positives and false negatives. Its architecture, which included multiple convolutional layers, dropout for regularization, and a dense classification head, was well-suited for learning domain-specific features in the malaria dataset.
The custom CNN model was built from scratch, allowing it to learn domain-specific features such as the presence of parasitic dots. Key components that contributed to its performance include:
  1. Three convolutional blocks with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dropout, enabling the network to extract detailed hierarchical features while reducing overfitting.
  2. A fully connected Dense layer with 512 neurons that helped capture complex patterns before classification.
  3. The final softmax layer with 2 output neurons, ideal for the binary classification setup with one-hot encoded labels.
For **further analysis and associated problems**, exploring incorporating of **additional data sources** like car condition reports or regional market variations could be considered. In addition to that, **investigating the feasibility of predicting future price trends** for informed pricing strategies could be done.

By addressing these recommendations and challenges, Cars4U can unlock the full potential of the data science approach and revolutionize the used car buying and selling experience in India.
